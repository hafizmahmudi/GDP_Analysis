#### 2. There Correlation between drop rates of % primary sector contribution, but negative correlation among drop out rates and secondary sector. Positive correlation between primary drop out rate and % Tertiary contrition to GDP, no correlation or a bit correlation between Secondary drop out rate and Tertiary sector but negative correlation between Upper Primary drop out rate and secondary sector.

#### 5. Each state should Manufacturing; Agriculture, forestry and fishing; Real Estate, and Trade; Real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services; Trade, repair, hotels and restaurants; and construction sub- sectors to increase GSVA.
#### 6. There is negative correlation between drop out rates and population. It means that when population increases the drop out decreases and when drop out increase the population decrease.
